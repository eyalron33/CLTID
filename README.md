# CLTID: Commander Locked Token

A name system based on Commander and Locked Token standards.

See Commander and Locked Token standards [here](github.com/woolballers/commander-token-contracts/).

This is an experimental project. The goal is to write a new codebase for a new system and try use-cases for Commander and Locked Token standards.
